This directory contains examples taken from [LearnOpengGL](https://learnopengl.com/) book also known as OpenGL orange book.  
Main author of this code is Joey De Vries.  
Original code repository is [here](https://github.com/JoeyDeVries/LearnOpenGL).

I use this directory  as my own playground place for educational purposes.

Difference between this directory and origin:
Each chapters subdir is a standalone project directory. Header files mostly located in dirs (glm is exception).
Add project file for Qt Creator support. Qt Creator is used only as IDE and build toolchain. Zero Qt Framework libs was used.
Add some changes in code.
